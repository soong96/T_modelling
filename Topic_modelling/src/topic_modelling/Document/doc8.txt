CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
[0001]
This is a divisional application based on pending application Ser. No. 12/155,106, filed May 29, 2008, the entire contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]
1. Field of the Invention
[0003]
Embodiments relate to a thin film transistor, a flat panel display device having the same, and associated methods.
[0004]
2. Description of the Related Art
[0005]
In general, a thin film transistor (“TFT”) includes a semiconductor layer and a gate electrode. The semiconductor layer includes a channel region, a source region, and a drain region. The gate electrode corresponds to the channel region of the semiconductor layer and is electrically insulated therefrom. The semiconductor layer may be formed of amorphous silicon or polysilicon. When the semiconductor layer is formed of amorphous silicon, the mobility may be low. Accordingly, it may be difficult to employ such TFT's in high speed circuits. In contrast, polysilicon may provide high mobility. The threshold voltage of TFT's formed from polysilicon may be non-uniform, however, and thus an additional compensating circuit may be required. Moreover, manufacturing a TFT using low temperature polysilicon (LTPS) may require expensive processes such as laser annealing, and it may be difficult to control operational characteristics for large area substrates.
[0006]
In view of the difficulties in advancing amorphous silicon and polysilicon TFT technologies, research into the use of compound semiconductors has been increasing. In particular, compound semiconductors formed of zinc oxide (ZnO), or including zinc oxide in combination with other materials, e.g., dopants, have been of interest. However, TFT's including compound semiconductors may exhibit relatively high resistivities, e.g., 1×104 to 1×106 O·cm. Accordingly, there may be a high contact resistance where metal electrodes contact source and drain regions formed from the compound semiconductor. Implanting hydrogen (H) atoms into the compound semiconductor may reduce the resistivity the semiconductor layer and reduce the contact resistance, but hydrogen in the channel region may increase leakage current.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0007]
Embodiments are therefore directed to a TFT, a flat panel display device having the same, and associated methods, which substantially overcome one or more of the problems due to the limitations and disadvantages of the related art.
[0008]
It is therefore a feature of an embodiment to provide a TFT having hydrogen in source and drain regions, and having a hydrogen diffusion barrier layer disposed on a channel region.
[0009]
It is therefore another feature of an embodiment to provide a flat panel display device having TFT's formed of a compound semiconductor.
[0010]
It is therefore another feature of an embodiment to provide a method of selectively diffusing hydrogen from a hydrogen-containing layer into source and drain regions of a TFT, while minimizing the diffusion of hydrogen into the channel region of the TFT.
[0011]
At least one of the above and other features and advantages may be realized by providing a thin film transistor, including a gate electrode, a first insulating layer on the gate electrode, a semiconductor layer on the gate electrode and separated from the gate electrode by the first insulating layer, the semiconductor layer including a channel region corresponding to the gate electrode, a source region, and a drain region, a hydrogen diffusion barrier layer on the semiconductor layer, the hydrogen diffusion barrier layer covering the channel region and exposing the source and drain regions, and a second insulation layer on the source and drain regions and on the hydrogen diffusion barrier layer, such that the hydrogen diffusion barrier layer is between the second insulation layer and the channel region.
[0012]

The semiconductor layer may include an oxygen-containing compound semiconductor. The oxygen-containing compound semiconductor may be zinc oxide. The oxygen-containing compound semiconductor may include zinc oxide doped with one or more of gallium, indium, or tin.

[0014]
At least one of the above and other features and advantages may also be realized by providing a flat panel display device, including an image display panel having pixels and thin film transistors coupled to the pixels. The thin film transistors may include a gate electrode, a first insulating layer on the gate electrode, a semiconductor layer on the gate electrode and separated from the gate electrode by the first insulating layer, the semiconductor layer including a channel region corresponding to the gate electrode, a source region, and a drain region, a hydrogen diffusion barrier layer on the semiconductor layer, the hydrogen diffusion barrier layer covering the channel region and exposing the source and drain regions, and a second insulation layer on the source and drain regions and on the hydrogen diffusion barrier layer, such that the hydrogen diffusion barrier layer is between the second insulation layer and the channel region.
[0015]
The image display panel may include a first substrate that includes the pixels and the thin film transistors coupled to the pixels, the pixels having a first electrode coupled to a corresponding thin film transistor, a second substrate having second electrodes corresponding to the pixels, and a liquid crystal layer between the first and second substrates. The image display panel may include a substrate having the thin film transistors formed thereon, and organic light emitting diodes corresponding to the pixels formed on the substrate. The organic light emitting diodes may be coupled to the thin film transistors.
[0016]
A concentration of hydrogen atoms in the source and drain regions may be larger than a concentration of hydrogen atoms in the channel region. The second insulation layer may contain hydrogen atoms. The semiconductor layer may include an oxygen-containing compound semiconductor. The hydrogen diffusion barrier layer may include one or more of a nitride, a carbide, or a ternary compound having a metal as a component thereof.
[0017]

The semiconductor layer may include an oxygen-containing compound semiconductor. The hydrogen diffusion barrier layer may include one or more of a nitride, a carbide, or a ternary compound having a metal as a component thereof.

[0032]
FIG. 1 illustrates a cross-sectional view of a TFT according to a first embodiment. Referring to FIG. 1, the TFT may be disposed on a substrate 10. The substrate 10 may have an insulating buffer layer 11 thereon. A gate electrode 12 may be on the buffer layer 11. A semiconductor layer 14 may extend across the gate electrode 12, the semiconductor layer 14 being insulated from the gate electrode 12 by a gate insulating layer 13. The semiconductor layer 14 may include a channel region 14 a, a source region 14 b, and a drain region 14 c.
[0033]
A hydrogen diffusion barrier layer 15 may be on the channel region 14 a of the semiconductor layer 14. An interlayer dielectric layer 16 may extend across the hydrogen diffusion barrier layer 15 and the semiconductor layer 14. The hydrogen diffusion barrier layer 15 may cover the channel region 14 a, such that the hydrogen diffusion barrier layer 15 is between the channel region 14 a and the interlayer dielectric layer 16. The hydrogen diffusion barrier layer 15 may expose the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c.
[0034]
Contact holes 18 may penetrate the interlayer dielectric layer 16. Source and drain electrodes 17 a and 17 b may be formed on the interlayer dielectric layer 16 so as to be coupled to exposed portions of the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c through the contact holes 18.
[0035]
In an implementation, the semiconductor layer 14 may be predominantly or completely formed from an oxygen-containing compound semiconductor. The compound semiconductor may include, e.g., zinc oxide, which may be doped with one or more elements such as gallium (Ga), indium (In), or tin (Sn) as a main component. The interlayer dielectric layer 16 may include hydrogen atoms 16 a and may be formed of, e.g., a nitride such as silicon nitride (SiNx). The source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c may also have portions that contain hydrogen atoms 16 a. The hydrogen atoms 16 a in the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c may be diffused from the hydrogen-containing interlayer dielectric layer 16, as described in greater detail below.
[0036]
In an implementation, the hydrogen-containing portions of the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c may correspond to an interface with the interlayer dielectric layer 16. The contact holes 18 may penetrate the interlayer dielectric layer 16 at the hydrogen-containing portions of the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c, and the source and drain electrodes 17 a and 17 b may be coupled to the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c through the contact holes 18. The hydrogen atoms 16A may penetrate into surfaces of the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c from the overlying interlayer dielectric layer 16 and may act as a shallow donor. Accordingly, the conductivity of the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c may be improved, i.e., the resistivity may be reduced. The reduction in the resistivity of the semiconductor layer due to the presence of hydrogen is described in a journal article entitled “Role of Intentionally Incorporated Hydrogen in Wide-Band-Gap ZnO Thin Film Prepared by Photo-MOCVD Technique,” Vol. 772, Physics of Semiconductors: 27th International Conference on the Physics of Semiconductors.
[0037]
The hydrogen diffusion barrier layer 15 may include one or more of a nitride, a carbide, or ternary compound that includes a metal as one of the three components. The hydrogen diffusion barrier layer 15 may include, e.g., one or more of titanium nitride (TiN), tantalum nitride (TaN), tungsten nitride (WN), titanium carbide (TiC), tantalum carbide (TaC), a ternary compound of titanium, silicon, and nitrogen (TiSiN), a ternary compound of tantalum, silicon, and nitrogen (TaSiN), or a ternary compound of tungsten, boron, and nitrogen (WBN).
[0038]
The hydrogen diffusion barrier layer 15 may prevent hydrogen atoms 16 a from diffusing from the interlayer dielectric layer 16 into the channel region 14 a, such that the resistivity of the channel region 14 may be unchanged, or may change by an insignificant amount. Thus, the concentration of hydrogen atoms 16 a in the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c may be larger than the concentration of hydrogen atoms 16 a in the channel region 14 a. Reducing the resistivity of the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c, as afforded by the hydrogen atoms contained in the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c, may improve the electrical characteristics of the TFT device by reducing contact resistance between the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c and corresponding source and drain electrodes 17 a and 17 b. At the same time, reducing or eliminating the introduction of hydrogen atoms 16 a into the channel region 14 a may prevent increases in leakage current in the channel region 14 a.
[0039]
FIGS. 2A-2D illustrate cross-sectional views of stages in a method of manufacturing a thin film transistor according to the first embodiment. With reference to FIG. 2A, after the gate electrode 12 is formed on a substrate 10, e.g., insulating substrate, a gate insulating layer 13 may be formed on the substrate 10 and on the gate electrode 12. The gate insulating layer 13 may contain little or no hydrogen. In an implementation, prior to a formation of the gate electrode 12, the buffer layer 11 may be formed from an insulator, e.g., an insulator having little or no hydrogen.
[0040]
Referring to FIG. 2B, a semiconductor layer 14 for providing a channel region 14 a, a source region 14 b, and a drain region 14 c may be formed on a gate insulating layer 13 that covers the gate electrode 12. The semiconductor layer 14 may extend across a portion of the substrate 10 so as to cover the gate electrode 12 and extend laterally away from the gate electrode 12 on opposite sides of the gate electrode 12. A hydrogen diffusion barrier layer 15 may be formed on the channel region 14 a of the semiconductor layer 14. The hydrogen diffusion barrier layer 15 may have a thickness of, e.g., 20 nm to 0.5 µm, and may be confined to the channel region 14 a, i.e., it may be over the gate electrode 12 while exposing some or all of the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c on opposite sides of the gate electrode 14.
[0041]
With reference to FIG. 2C, the interlayer dielectric layer 16 may be formed on the semiconductor layer 14 so as to cover some or all of the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c. The interlayer dielectric layer 16 may cover the channel regions 14 a, and the hydrogen diffusion barrier 15 may be disposed between the channel region 14 a and the interlayer dielectric layer 16. The interlayer dielectric layer 16 may be formed of, e.g., silicon nitride such as silicon oxy nitride (SiON), and may contain hydrogen.
[0042]
Subsequently, in order to diffuse the hydrogen atoms 16 a from the interlayer dielectric layer 16 into the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c, a thermal treatment may be performed. For example, the thermal treatment may be performed at a temperature of about 300° C. for about 1 hour or more. The hydrogen atoms 16 a contained in the interlayer dielectric layer 16 may diffuse into the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c through an interface A, as illustrated in FIG. 2C. The hydrogen diffused into the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c may reduce the resistivity, i.e., improve the conductivity, of the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c. Due to the hydrogen diffusion barrier layer 15, however, the hydrogen atoms 16 a may be substantially prevented from diffusing to the channel region 14 a. Accordingly, the resistivity of the channel region 14 a may be unchanged, or may change by an insignificant amount.
[0043]
With reference to FIG. 2D, contact holes 18 may be formed in the interlayer dielectric layer 16 so as to expose portions of the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c that include hydrogen, i.e., regions having a relatively high concentration of hydrogen as a result of the diffusion thereof from the interlayer dielectric layer 16. The source and drain electrodes 17 a and 17 b may be formed on the interlayer dielectric layer 16, and may be coupled to the respective source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c through the contact holes 18.
[0044]
As described above, the hydrogen diffusion barrier layer 15 may be formed on the channel region 14 a of the semiconductor layer 14. Accordingly, while the hydrogen atoms 16 a contained in the interlayer dielectric layer 16 may be diffused into the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c, the hydrogen diffusion barrier layer 15 may substantially prevent the hydrogen atoms 16 a from penetrating into the channel region 14 a. Further, in an implementation, the buffer layer 11 and the gate insulating layer 13 may be formed of materials that do not contain hydrogen atoms, so as to avoid providing hydrogen atoms that could penetrate into the channel region 14 a.
[0045]
FIG. 3 illustrates a perspective view of a flat panel display device according to a second embodiment. The flat panel display device may include a display panel 100 for displaying images as a main element thereof. The display panel 100 may includes two substrates 110 and 120, and a liquid crystal layer 130. The two substrates 110 and 120 may be disposed opposite to each other, and the liquid crystal layer 130 may be interposed between the two substrates 110 and 120.

The TFT's may each include the gate electrode 12, the semiconductor layer 14, the hydrogen diffusion barrier layer 15, the interlayer dielectric layer 16, and the source and drain electrodes 17 a and 17 b. The gate electrode 12 may be formed on the substrate 110. The semiconductor layer 14 may be insulated from the gate electrode 12 by the gate insulation layer 13, and may provide the channel region 14 a, as well as the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c. The hydrogen diffusion barrier layer 15 may be formed on the channel region 14 a of the semiconductor layer 14. The interlayer dielectric layer 16 may contain hydrogen atoms 16 a, and contact holes 18 may be formed in the interlayer dielectric layer 16 to expose the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c. The source and drain electrodes 17 a and 17 b may be coupled to the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c through the contact holes 18. The source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c may include hydrogen atoms 16 a, which may be diffused from the interlayer dielectric layer 16.
[0047]

A back light (not shown) may be disposed at a lower portion of the first polarizer 116 as a light source. One or more LCD driver IC's (not shown) may be mounted around the pixel region 113 of the display panel 100 and may function to drive the display panel 100. The LCD driver may convert an external electric signal into a scan signal and a data signal, and provide the scan and data signals to gate lines 111 and data lines 112, respectively.
[0048]

Referring to FIG. 4A, a substrate 210 may be have a pixel region 220 and a non-pixel region 230. The non-pixel region 230 may enclose, i.e., surround, the pixel region 220.

The scan driver 234 and the data driver 236 may process externally-provided signals, which may be provided via pads 228, and supply the processed signals to the scan lines 224 and the data lines 226.
[0049]

[0050]
As illustrated in FIG. 5, a TFT according to the first embodiment may be formed in the pixel region 220 on the substrate 210 and may be coupled to the OLED 300 to control operation of the OLED 300. A capacitor (not shown) may be further provided, and may function to maintain signals. The TFT may be constructed as described above in connection with FIG. 1, and may be fabricated by the method described in connection with FIGS. 2A-2D. That is, as described above, the TFT may be formed on the substrate 210, which may be an insulating substrate. As described above, in an implementation, the buffer layer 11 may be provided under the TFT's. The TFT's may each include the gate electrode 12, the semiconductor layer 14, the hydrogen diffusion barrier layer 15, the interlayer dielectric layer 16, and the source and drain electrodes 17 a and 17 b.

The pad 228 may be formed on the non-pixel region 230, and the data line 226 may extend from the pixel region 220 to the non-pixel region 230.
[0052]
Referring to FIGS. 4A and 5, the OLED 300 may be coupled with the TFT having a structure as described above in connection with FIG. 1. In particular, referring to FIG. 5, a planarization layer 20 may be formed in order to provide a planar surface over the TFT. A via hole may be formed in the planarization layer 20 to expose a predetermined part of the source electrode 17 a or the drain electrode 17 b. The anode electrode 317 may be coupled to the source electrode 17 a or the drain electrode 17 b through the via hole.

[0054]
As described above, according to embodiments a hydrogen barrier layer may prevent hydrogen atoms contained in an interlayer dielectric layer from penetrating into a channel region while the hydrogen atoms are diffused into source and drain regions. Due to the diffusion of the hydrogen atoms, the resistivity of the source and drain regions may be reduced. However, since the hydrogen atoms may be substantially prevented from diffusing into the channel region, the resistivity of the channel region may not change, or may be changed by an insignificant amount. As a result, the resistivity of the source and drain regions may be reduced, while avoiding increases in leakage current in the channel region, Thus, a device containing the TFT may exhibit improved electrical characteristics.
