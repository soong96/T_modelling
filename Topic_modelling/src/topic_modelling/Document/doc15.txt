CLAIM OF PRIORITY
[0001]
This application makes reference to, incorporates the same herein, and claims all benefits accruing under 35 U.S.C. §119 from an application earlier filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on the 20th of January 2009 and there duly assigned Serial No. 10-2009-0004549.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]
1. Field of the Invention
[0003]
The present invention relates to a thin film transistor, a manufacturing method thereof, and a flat panel display device having the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to a thin film transistor using an oxide semiconductor as an active layer, a manufacturing method thereof, and a flat panel display device having the same.
[0004]
2. Description of the Related Art
[0005]
Flat panel display devices such as a liquid crystal display device (LCD) and an organic light emitting display device (OLED) are classified into a passive matrix type and an active matrix type according to a driving method of pixels.
[0006]
Since respective pixels are controlled by thin film transistors (TFT) serving as a switch, the active matrix type flat panel display device has a short response time and a high image quality.
[0007]
In the thin film transistor used in the active matrix type flat panel display device, an active layer for providing source and drain regions and a channel region is made of semiconductor such as amorphous silicon, poly-silicon, and low temperature poly-silicon (LTPS).
[0008]
However, when the active layer is formed of amorphous silicon, it is difficult to realize a drive circuit operated at a high speed due to its low mobility. When the active layer is formed of poly-silicon, since its threshold voltage is not uniform due to its polycrystalline nature. An active layer formed of low-temperature poly-silicon requires the laser heat treatment for crystallization.
[0009]
In order to solve the above problems, studies on use of an oxide semiconductor layer as an active layer are recently being carried out.
[0010]
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2004-273614 discloses a thin film transistor in which an oxide semiconductor mainly consists of zinc oxide (ZnO) as an active layer.
[0011]
The oxide semiconductor mainly consisting of zinc oxide (ZnO) is judged to be amorphous and stable. When such an oxide semiconductor is used as an active layer, a thin film transistor can be manufactured at a low temperature using conventional equipment without purchasing separate equipment and processes such as ion implantation can be omitted.
[0012]
However, since the oxide semiconductor has a low etching selectivity with respect to silicon oxide (SiOx) or silicon nitride (SiNx) used as a gate insulating layer, the active layer may be deteriorated during the patterning of the gate insulating layer. Like the thin film transistor of Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2004-273614, in a structure in which source and drain electrode are overlapped with a gate electrode, a signal delay or cross talk may be occurred due to parasitic capacitance between the source and drain electrodes and the gate electrode.
[0013]
The above information disclosed in this Related Art section is only for enhancement of understanding of the background of the invention and therefore it may contain information that does not form the prior art that is already known to a person of ordinary skill in the art.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Accordingly, it is an aspect of the present invention to provide a thin film transistor capable of preventing deterioration of an active layer that occurs during the patterning of a gate insulating layer, a method of manufacturing the same, and a flat panel display device having the same.
[0015]
It is another aspect of the present invention to provide a thin film transistor capable of miniaturizing parasitic capacitance between source and drain electrodes and a gate electrode, a method of manufacturing the same, and a flat panel display device having the same.

Since the gate insulating layer is formed of a dielectric with a high etching selectivity with respect to oxide semiconductor, deterioration of the active layer does not occur during the patterning of the gate insulating layer.

[0036]
Referring to FIG. 1, buffer layer 11 is formed on substrate 10, and active layer 12 made of an oxide semiconductor is formed on buffer layer 11. Active layer 12 providing source and drain regions and a channel region is made of zinc oxide (ZnO), ZnGaO, ZnInO, ZnSnO, or GaInZnO on which at least one ion of gallium (Ga), indium (In), stannum (Sn), zirconium (Zr), hafnium (Hf), and vanadium (V) is doped to zinc oxide (ZnO).
[0037]
Gate insulating layer 13 and gate electrode 14 are formed on active layer 12. Gate insulating layer 13 and gate electrode 14 are formed on the channel region of oxide semiconductor layer 12. Gate insulating layer 13 is formed of a dielectric having an etching selectivity with respect to the oxide semiconductor forming active layer 12 higher than 20:1, preferably 20 to 100:1. Aluminum oxide (AlxOy), hafnium oxide (HfxOy), yttrium oxide (YxOy), zirconium oxide (ZrxOy), and Gallium oxide (GaOx), or a mixture thereof can be used as the dielectric having a high dielectric constant (high-k) of 3 to 30. In the dielectrics, x and y are preferably in a range of 1 to 3.
[0038]
Insulating layer 15 is formed on the substrate including gate electrode 14, and contact holes are formed in insulating layer 15 to expose the source and drain regions of active layer 12. Source and drain electrodes 16 are formed on insulating layer 15 to be connected to the source and drain regions of active layer 12 through the contact holes. In this case, source and drain electrodes 16 are formed without overlapping with gate electrode 14.
[0039]
As described above, the thin film transistor according to the present invention, since the active layer is formed of an oxide semiconductor, a thin film transistor can be manufactured at a low temperature using conventional equipment without purchasing separate equipment and processes such as ion implantation can be omitted. Moreover, since source and drain electrodes 16 are not overlapped with gate electrode 14, a parasitic capacitance between source and drain electrodes 16 and gate electrode 14 is miniaturized so that a signal delay or cross talk does not occur.
[0040]
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail through a process of manufacturing the thin film transistor.
[0041]
FIGS. 2A to 2D are cross-sectional views illustrating a method of manufacturing a thin film transistor according to the present invention.
[0042]
Referring to FIG. 2A, after forming buffer layer 11 the substrate 10, oxide semiconductor layer 12 a, dielectric layer 13 a, and conductive layer 14 a are sequentially formed on buffer layer 11.
[0043]
Oxide semiconductor layer 12 a is formed of zinc oxide (ZnO) or ZnGaO, ZnInO, ZnSnO, and GaInZnO that are zinc oxide (ZnO) doped with at least one ion of gallium (Ga), indium (In), stannum (Sn), zirconium (Zr), hafnium (Hf), and vanadium (V). Moreover, the dielectric layer 13 a is formed of a dielectric having an etching selectivity with respect to the oxide semiconductor forming active layer 12 a higher than 20:1, preferably 20 to 100:1. Aluminum oxide (AlxOy), hafnium oxide (HfxOy), yttrium oxide (YxOy), zirconium oxide (ZrxOy), and Gallium oxide (GaOx), or a mixture thereof can be used as the dielectric having a high dielectric constant (high-k) of 3 to 30.
[0044]
Referring to FIG. 2B, the gate electrode 14 is formed by patterning conductive layer 14 a, and then the gate insulating layer 13 is formed by patterning dielectric layer 13 a via etching using gate electrode 14 as a mask. The etching process for patterning dielectric layer 13 a is performed by a dry etching process, in which oxide semiconductor layer 12 a is not deteriorated due to a high etching selectivity even when oxide semiconductor layer 12 a is exposed during the patterning of dielectric layer 13 a.
[0045]
If dielectric layer 13 a is formed of silicon oxide (SiOx) or silicon nitride (SiNx) having a dielectric constant of 2 to 3, since the silicon oxide (SiOx) and the silicon nitride (SiNx) have an etching selectivity of 10:1 with respect to the oxide semiconductor, active layer 12 may be deteriorated. However, since dielectric layer 13 a is formed of material having an etching selectivity of 20 to 100:1 with respect to the oxide semiconductor, it is possible to prevent oxide semiconductor layer 12 a exposed during the patterning of dielectric layer 13 a from being deteriorated. Moreover, since gate insulating layer 13 is formed of a dielectric having a high dielectric constant, when a capacitor of metal/insulator/semiconductor structure having gate electrode 14 and active layer 12 as electrodes, for example, when a capacitor connected to a transistor is implemented, high capacitance can be easily achieved.
[0046]
Referring to FIG. 2C, active layer 12 is formed by patterning the oxide semiconductor layer 12 a. Active layer 12 is formed such that the channel region thereof overlaps with gate electrode 12. Active layer 12 is formed to have a width greater than gate electrode 14 such that both sides of gate electrode 14, i.e., the source and drain regions of active layer 12, can be exposed.
[0047]
Referring to FIG. 2D, after forming insulating layer 15 on the substrate including gate electrode 14 with silicon oxide (SiOx), silicon nitride (SiNx), and silicon oxynitride (SiONx), contact holes 15 a are formed to expose the active layer at both sides of gate electrode 14. Source and drain electrodes 16 are formed on insulating layer 15 to be connected to active layer 12 through contact holes 15 a. In this case, source and drain electrodes 16 do not overlapped with gate electrode 14.
[0048]
