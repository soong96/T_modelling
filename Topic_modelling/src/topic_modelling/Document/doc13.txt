BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]
1. Field of the Invention
[0003]
The present invention relates to a thin film transistor and a flat panel display incorporating the same thin film transistor, and more particularly, to an oxide semiconductor thin film transistor to which a copper (Cu) wire is applied, and a flat panel display device incorporating the same thin film transistor.
[0004]
2. Description of the Related Art
[0005]
A thin film transistor is generally constructed with a semiconductor layer in which a channel region, a source region and a drain region are provided, a gate electrode that is overlapped with the channel region and is insulated from the semiconductor layer by a gate insulating layer, and a source electrode and a drain electrode that is coupled to the semiconductor layer in the source region and the drain region.
[0006]
The thin film transistor constituted as described above is applied not only to a semiconductor integrated circuit but also to a flat panel display device such as a liquid crystal display device (LCD) or an active-matrix organic light emitting display device (AMOLED).
[0007]
In the flat panel display device, electrodes and wires such as scan lines and data lines of the thin film transistor are made of metal such as molybdenum (Mo), aluminum (Al) and tungsten (W), or an alloy thereof.
[0008]
Such a metal or alloy, however, has a high specific resistance of 11 µOcm so that if resolution and size of the flat panel display device are increased, a problem arises in that a wire resistance is abruptly increased due to the decrease in wire width and the increase in wire length. If the wire resistance is increased, current or voltage applied to a pixel becomes undesirably uneven due to the voltage drop (current-resistance drop, IR drop) so that a defect is generated or an image quality is deteriorated.
[0009]
Therefore, there is a demand for a study on wire material that can prevent the defect and the deterioration in the image quality of the flat panel display device in accordance with the increase in resolution and size, and a method of manufacturing the same.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0010]
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved thin film transistor and an improved flat panel display device incorporating the thin film transistor.
[0011]
It is another object of the present invention to provide a thin film transistor that can prevent a voltage drop in accordance with decrease in wire width and increase in wire length, and a flat panel display device incorporating the same thin film transistor.
[0012]
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a thin film transistor to which a copper (Cu) wire having a small specific resistance is applied, and a flat panel display device incorporating the same thin film transistor.
[0013]
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a thin film transistor in which a copper wire and an oxide semiconductor layer form a stable interface junction to have a small contact resistance and a diffusion of copper to the oxide semiconductor layer can be prevented, and a flat panel display device incorporating the same thin film transistor.
[0014]
These and other objects may be attained in the practice of the principles of the present invention, with a thin film transistor including a substrate, a gate electrode formed on the substrate, a gate insulating layer formed on the substrate and covering the gate electrode, an oxide semiconductor layer formed on the gate insulating layer and covering the gate electrode, a titanium layer formed in a source region and a drain region of the oxide semiconductor layer, and source and drain electrodes respectively coupled to the source region and the drain region through the titanium layer and made of copper.
[0015]
The principles of the present invention may be practiced in a flat panel display device which has a thin film transistor. The flat panel display device may be constructed with a first substrate on which a pixel defined by a first conductive line and a second conductive line, and the thin film transistor that controls signals supplied to each pixel and a first electrode coupled to the thin film transistor are formed, a second substrate on which a second electrode is formed, and a liquid crystal layer injected into a space sealed between the first electrode and the second electrode. The thin film transistor includes a gate electrode formed on the first substrate, a gate insulating layer formed on the substrate and covering the gate electrode, an oxide semiconductor layer formed on the gate insulating layer and covering the gate electrode, a titanium layer formed in a source region and a drain region of the oxide semiconductor layer, and source and drain electrodes coupled to the source region and the drain region through the titanium layer and made of copper.

The flat panel display device includes a first substrate on which a first conductive layer and a second conductive layer, the thin film transistor coupled between the first conductive layer and the second conductive layer, and an organic light emitting device coupled to the thin film transistor and including a first electrode, an organic thin film layer and a second electrode are formed; and a second substrate disposed to be opposed to the first substrate.

[0017]
In the oxide semiconductor thin film transistor according to the present invention, wires such as the source and drain electrodes are made of copper having a small specific resistance, and the titanium layer is interposed between the source and drain electrodes made of copper and the oxide semiconductor layer. The titanium layer reduces the contact resistance between the source and drain electrodes and the oxide semiconductor layer, forms a stable interface junction therebetween, and blocks a diffusion of copper.

[0026]

[0027]
Recently, a study on an oxide semiconductor thin film transistor has been actively progressed. An oxide semiconductor having zinc oxide (ZnO) as a main ingredient has been evaluated as a stable material having an amorphous shape. The use of the oxide semiconductor lead to various advantages in manufacturing process in that a thin film transistor can be made at a low temperature using a contemporary process equipment, without buying a separate equipment additionally, and an ion implantation process can be omitted, and so on.
[0028]
Together with the oxide semiconductor, a study on usage of a copper (Cu) wire having a smaller specific resistance rather than molybdenum (Mo) or aluminum (Al) has also been actively progressed in order to reduce the wire resistance.
[0029]
If the cooper wire is applied to the oxide semiconductor thin film transistor, however, an interface junction between the copper wire (for example, a source electrode and a drain electrode) and the oxide semiconductor becomes defective and electrical property of the oxide semiconductor is undesirably deteriorated due to the diffusion of copper atoms during an annealing process. In other words, a contact resistance between the copper wire and the oxide semiconductor is increased by the defective interface junction, and p-type copper atoms are diffused to an n-type oxide semiconductor so that the electrical property of the oxide semiconductor is deteriorated.
[0030]
Therefore, in order to apply the cooper wire to the oxide semiconductor thin film transistor, there is a demand for a technical development that can solve the problems as described above.
[0031]
Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments according to the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.
[0032]
FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a thin film transistor constructed as an embodiment according to the principles of the present invention. FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of a thin film transistor constructed as another embodiment according to the principles of the present invention.
[0033]
Referring to FIG. 1, a buffer layer 11 is formed on a substrate 10, and a gate electrode 12 is formed on buffer layer 11. A gate insulating layer 13 is formed on the entire substrate and covering gate electrode 12, and an oxide semiconductor layer 14 is formed on gate insulating layer 13 and covering gate electrode 12. Oxide semiconductor layer 14 functions as an activation layer in which a channel region 14 a, a source region 14 b, and a drain region 14 c are provided. A titanium (Ti) layer 15 is formed on oxide semiconductor layer 14 in source region 14 b and drain region 14 c, and source and drain electrodes 16 a and 16 b made of copper (Cu) are formed to be coupled to source region 14 b and drain region 14 c, respectively, through titanium layer 15.
[0034]
FIG. 1 shows a structure where titanium layer 15 is formed only on oxide semiconductor layer 14 in source region 14 b and drain region 14 c, and FIG. 2 shows a structure where a titanium layer 25 overlaps the entirety of the bottom surface of source and drain electrodes 16 a and 16 b. The structure shown in FIG. 2 can be formed by patterning titanium layer 25 and source and drain electrodes 16 a and 16 b by using one mask, making it possible to reduce the number of masks and process steps for fabricating the thin film transistor compared to that of the structure shown in FIG. 1.
[0035]
Substrate 10 may be formed of a semiconductor substrate such as silicon (Si), etc., an insulating substrate such as glass or plastic, etc., or a metal substrate. Gate electrode 12 may be made of metal such as Al, Cr, MoW, etc. Gate insulating layer 13 may be formed of insulating material such as SiO2, SiNx, Ga2O3, etc.
[0036]
Oxide semiconductor layer 14 may include zinc oxide (ZnO) and may be doped with one ion selected from a group of gallium (Ga), indium (In), stannum (Sn), zirconium (Zr), hafnium (Hf), cadmium (Cd), silver (Ag), copper (Cu), germanium (Ge), gadolinium (Gd), and vanadium (V). Oxide semiconductor layer 14 may be made of ZnO, ZnGaO, ZnInO, ZnSnO, GaInZnO, CdO, InO, GaO, SnO, AgO, CuO, GeO, GdO, and HfO by way of example.
[0037]
Titanium layers 15 and 25 may have a thickness that is changed during a subsequent process such as an annealing process so that it is preferable that titanium layers 15 and 25 are deposited in consideration of the change in thickness.
[0038]
As described above, in the thin film transistor according to the present invention, the activation layer is formed of oxide semiconductor layer 14, source and drain electrodes 16 a and 16 b are made of copper (Cu), and titanium layers 15 and 25 are interposed between oxide semiconductor layer 14 and source and drain electrodes 16 a and 16 b.
[0039]
In the thin film transistor having the structure as described above, titanium layers 15 and 25 reduce the contact resistance between source and drain electrodes 16 a and 16 b and oxide semiconductor layer 14.
[0040]
FIGS. 3 and 4 are graphs showing changes in drain current Id, measured in amperes, as a function of the gate voltage Vg, measured in volts, of different thin film transistors. In FIGS. 3 and 4, an individual curve represents one current-voltage measurement of the same thin film transistor. The thin film transistors represented by FIG. 3 have structures where titanium layers 15 and 25 are interposed between source and drain electrodes 16 a and 16 b and zinc oxide (ZnO) layer 14 constructed as exemplar embodiments according to the principles of the present invention, and the thin film transistors represented by FIG. 4 have structures where the source and drain electrodes made of molybdenum (Mo) directly contact the zinc oxide (ZnO) layer constructed as a comparative example. Comparing the sections of Vg=10V˜30V in FIGS. 3 and 4, the value of Id in FIG. 3 is higher than the value of Id in FIG. 4.
[0041]
Table 1 summaries threshold voltage, carrier mobility and sub-threshold slope of the thin film transistor constructed as the example of the present invention and the thin film transistor constructed as the comparative example obtained through graphs shown in FIGS. 3 and 4.
[0000]
TABLE 1
Threshold		
voltage (V)	Mobility (cm2/Vs)	S-Slope (V/Dec)
Aver-	Standard	Aver-	Standard	Aver-	Standard
age	deviation	age	deviation	age	deviation
Mo/ZnO	1.86	0.17	7.76	1.67	0.43	0.02
Cu/Ti/ZnO	1.25	0.10	15.45	1.23	0.52	0.03
[0042]
Referring to Table 1, the negative shift of the threshold voltage Vth_sat from the comparative example to the example of the present invention means that charge is easily injected to the oxide semiconductor layer of the thin film transistor of the present invention. The increase in the mobility from the example of the present invention to the comparative example means that the amount of charges injected to the oxide semiconductor layer of the thin film transistor of the present invention is increased. Therefore, it can be appreciated that the contact resistance in a structure where titanium (Ti) contacts zinc oxide (ZnO) (FIG. 3) is reduced by twice or three times compared to a structure where molybdenum (Mo) electrode directly contacts zinc oxide (ZnO) (FIG. 4).
[0043]
Also, in the thin film transistor having the structure as described according to FIGS. 1 and 2, titanium layers 15 and 25 allow source and drain electrodes 16 a and 16 b and oxide semiconductor layer 14 to have a stable junction and block a diffusion of copper.
[0044]
Titanium (Ti) forms an excellent interface junction with copper (Cu) and zinc oxide (ZnO), thereby allowing source and drain electrodes 16 a and 16 b and oxide semiconductor layer 14 to have a stable interface junction. Also, titanium (Ti) functions as a trap that blocks the diffusion of copper (Cu), thereby efficiently blocking the diffusion of copper to oxide semiconductor layer 14.
[0045]
Therefore, the current-voltage property is improved by the copper wire having a low specific resistance and the deterioration in the property of the oxide semiconductor layer by the diffusion of copper is prevented, thereby making it possible to implement the thin film transistor having an improved electrical property.
[0046]
