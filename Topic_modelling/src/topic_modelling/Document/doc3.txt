[0001]
This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 2008-66002, filed on Jul. 8, 2008, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein, by reference.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]
1. Field of the Invention
[0003]
Aspects of the present invention relate to a thin film transistor, a method of manufacturing the same, and a flat panel display device including the same.
[0004]
2. Description of the Related Art
[0005]
A thin film transistor generally includes: an activation layer including a channel region, a source region, and a drain region; and a gate electrode which is formed on the channel region. The gate electrode is electrically insulated from the activation layer, by a gate insulating film.
[0006]
An activation layer is generally formed of semiconductor material, such as amorphous silicon or poly-silicon. However, if an activation layer is formed of amorphous silicon, it is difficult to implement a high speed driving circuit, due to it having low electron mobility. If the activation layer is formed of poly-silicon, a separate compensation circuit should be added, due to uneven threshold voltages.
[0007]
A conventional method of manufacturing a thin film transistor, using a low temperature poly-silicon (LTPS), involves an expensive process such as a laser annealing. In addition, such a method is difficult to apply to larger substrates.
[0008]
Research into using a compound semiconductor as an activation layer has been recently conducted, in order to solve the above problems. For example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2004-273614 discloses a thin film transistor that has a zinc oxide (ZnO), or a compound semiconductor having zinc oxide (ZnO), as a main ingredient, as an activation layer.
[0009]
The compound semiconductor is evaluated as a stable material, having an amorphous shape. If such a compound semiconductor is used as an activation layer, the compound semiconductor has various advantages, in that the thin film transistor may be manufactured at a temperature below 350° C., using existing processing equipment. In addition, an ion implantation process may be omitted.
[0010]
However, a compound semiconductor can be damaged by plasma, when a thin film formed thereon is etched. Such damage degrades the electrical properties of the compound semiconductor, such that the threshold voltage of the thin film transistor changes.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

[0034]
FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a thin film transistor, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In the thin film transistor, a buffer layer 11 is formed on a substrate 10, and a gate electrode 12 is formed on the buffer layer 11. An activation layer 14, which is insulated from the gate electrode 12 by a gate insulating film 13, is formed on the gate insulating film 13, over the gate electrode 12. The activation layer 14 can be formed of a compound semiconductor oxide. A channel region 14 a, a source region 14 b, and a drain region 14 c are provided in the activation layer 14. The channel region 14 a overlaps the gate electrode 12.
[0035]
A passivation layer 15 is formed on the activation layer 14 and the insulating film 13. Contact holes are formed in the passivation layer 15, which expose the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c. Source and drain electrodes 16 a and 16 b are formed on the passivation layer, and contact the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c, through the contact holes.
[0036]
The activation layer 14 may be formed of a compound semiconductor oxide or zinc oxide (ZnO). Herein, a compound semiconductor oxide refers to a semiconductor compound including elements from two or more different groups of the periodic table and oxygen. The activation layer 14 may be doped with at least one ion of gallium (Ga), indium (In), stannum (Sn), zirconium (Zr), hafnium (Hf), and vanadium (V). The passivation layer 15 is formed of an inorganic oxide. The inorganic oxide may include elements being selected from a group consisting of gallium (Ga), indium (In), stannum (Sn), zirconium (Zr), hafnium (Hf), and vanadium (V), or may include silicon (Si) or aluminum (Al).
[0037]
FIGS. 2A to 2D are cross-sectional views of a method of manufacturing a thin film transistor, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 2A, a buffer layer 11 is formed on a substrate 10, and a gate electrode 12 is formed on the buffer layer 11. A gate insulating film 13 is formed on the gate electrode 12 and the buffer layer 11. The substrate 10 may be a semiconductor substrate such as silicon (Si); an insulating substrate, such as glass, or plastic; or a metal substrate. The gate electrode 12 may include Al, Cr, or MoW, or may include a conductive polymer. The gate insulating film 13 may be formed of an insulating material, such as SiO2, SiNx, or Ga2O3.
[0038]
Referring to FIG. 2B, the activation layer 14 is formed on the gate insulating film 13, above the gate electrode 12. The activation layer 14 includes a channel region 14 a, a source region 14 b, and a drain region 14 c. The activation layer 14 may be formed of the compound semiconductor oxide or zinc oxide. For example, the activation layer 14 may be formed of ZnO, ZnGaO, ZnInO, ZnSnO, or GaInZnO.
[0039]
Referring to FIG. 2C, the passivation layer 15 is then patterned, thereby forming contact holes 15 a that expose the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c. The passivation layer 15 is formed of an inorganic oxide including, for example, elements being selected from a group consisting of gallium (Ga), indium (In), stannum (Sn), zirconium (Zr), hafnium (Hf), and vanadium (V), or may include silicon (Si) or aluminum (Al). The passivation layer 15 may be formed of the same material as the compound semiconductor oxide. For example, the passivation layer may be formed of ZnO, ZnGaO, ZnInO, ZnSnO, GaO, HfO, or GaInZnO. The passivation layer 15 may alternatively include at least some elements included in the compound semiconductor oxide, such as Ga2O3. The passivation layer 15 may also include a silicon oxide (SiO2), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), or aluminum oxynitride (ALON).
[0040]
When a silicon oxide is used, a deposition temperature is set to below 300° C., and an oxygen partial pressure is set to at least 50%. When the aluminum oxide is used, the deposition temperature is set to below 300° C., and the content of aluminum (Al) is set to from 2 to 50%. When the aluminum oxynitride is used, the oxygen partial pressure is set to about 4%, during a sputtering deposition process, using a target of aluminum oxide (Al2O3), in an atmosphere of nitrogen and argon.
[0041]
Referring to FIG. 2D, after a conductive layer is formed on the passivation layer 15 and in the contact holes 15 a, the conductive layer is patterned, thereby forming source and drain electrodes 16 a and 16 b, which contact with the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c, through the contact holes 15 a. The source and drain electrodes 16 a and 16 b may be formed of a metal, such as Mo, MoW, Al, AlNd, or AlLiLa.
[0042]
The passivation layer 15 may be used as an etch stop layer, during the patterning of the conductive layer, which facilitates the etching process. The activation layer 14 is thereby protected in the channel region 14 a, during the etching process. Contamination of the activation layer 14, due to organic material from a subsequent process, is also prevented.
[0043]
However, when the passivation layer 15 is formed of material having low etching selectivity, with respect to the compound semiconductor, the activation layer 14 may be damaged during the etching of the contact holes 15 a. The material and/or the etching method should thus be selected accordingly. When the activation layer 14 is damaged, the activation layer 14 may be restored, however, if the activation layer 14 is annealed at a temperature of from 200 to 350° C., in vacuum of about 10 e2, and in an atmosphere of nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2), after the source and drain electrodes 16 a and 16 b are formed.
[0044]
A deterioration of the electrical properties of the compound semiconductor, due to plasma damage, is inferred to be primarily generated by an oxygen deficiency, resulting from the breakage of surface gratings. Therefore, aspects of the present invention protect the activation layer 14, by using the inorganic oxide passivation layer 15. This also permits the restoration of the activation layer 14, through the subsequent annealing. The restoration of the activation layer 14 is inferred to result from oxygen diffusing from the passivation layer 15.
[0045]
FIGS. 3A is a graph showing drain currents Id(A), according to gate voltages Vg of a thin transistor, that does not include a passivation layer is not formed. FIG. 3B is a graph showing threshold voltages Vth over time, of the transistor. FIG. 4A is a graph showing a change of a drain currents Id(A), according to gate voltages Vg, of a thin transistor including a passivation layer 15 formed according to aspects of the present invention. FIG. 4B is a graph illustrating threshold voltages Vth according to stress time, of the transistor including the passivation layer 15. The measurement is performed for 50 hours, during which a voltage Vds of 10 V is applied to source and drain electrodes 16 a and 16 b. The gate voltage Vg is set to a current of 3 µA.
[0046]
In the cases of FIGS. 3A and 3B, the threshold voltage Vth abruptly increases in a positive (+) direction, as time elapses, and the threshold voltage increases such that it cannot be accurately measured after about 5 hours. On the contrary, in the cases of FIGS. 4A and 4B, the fluctuation width of the threshold voltage Vth is less than about 1V and remains stable for over 50 hours.
[0047]
In a conventional thin film transistor having a polysilicon activation layer, a passivation layer is generally formed of a silicon oxide (SiO2), silicon nitride (SiNx), or aluminum oxide (Al2O3). However, in the case of a thin film transistor having an activation layer formed of a compound semiconductor oxide, if a passivation layer is formed of a conventionally formed silicon oxide (SiO2), silicon nitride (SiNx), or aluminum oxide (Al2O3), the electrical properties thereof, can be seriously degraded. This degradation is inferred to be generated by plasma during a deposition process. If the damage occurs, the carrier concentration of the activation layer may increase, due to an oxygen deficiency. In addition, an off current may increase, due to the increased carrier concentration, resulting in a reduction in the S-factor thereof.
[0048]
FIG. 5A is a graph showing electrical properties of a thin film transistor, in which a passivation layer is not yet formed. FIG. 5B and 5C are graphs showing the electrical properties of a thin film transistor, in which a silicon oxide (SiO2) passivation layer and an aluminum oxide (Al2O3) passivation layer are formed, respectively. The passivation layers were formed using a conventional process. As shown in FIGS. 5B and 5C, after forming the silicon oxide (SiO2) passivation layer and the aluminum oxide (Al2O3) passivation layer, the electrical properties of the thin film transistors were reduced, as indicated by the I-V (current-voltage) curves.
[0049]
FIG. 6A shows results from a thin film transistor including a GaInZnO passivation layer and a GaInZnO activation layer. FIG. 6B shows results from a thin film transistor including a Ga2O3 passivation layer and a GaInZnO activation layer. The threshold voltage increased by about 2.4V (FIG. 6A), and decreased by about 0.2V (FIG. 6B), as compared to the threshold voltage of 3.3V shown in FIG. 5A, when thin film transistor did not include the passivation layer.
[0050]
FIGS. 7A and 7B are graphs showing the reliability of a thin film transistor including an activation layer 14 formed by depositing GaInZnO at a pressure of 3 mTorr, and a Ga2O3 passivation layer, according to aspects of the present invention. In FIGS. 7A and 7B, the dashed lines represent a threshold voltage Vth, and the solid lines represent noise or abrupt voltage changes. The source and drain voltage was 10V, and the gate voltage was set to insure a constant current of 3 µA.
[0051]
There was slight changes in both cases when the measurements were taken after 50 hours (FIG. 7A) and after 10000 hours (FIG. 7B). From the dashed line of FIG. 7, which shows the change of the threshold voltage Vth, it is inferred that there may be a change of 1.2V or less, after 30000 hours.
[0052]
The stable electrical properties are due to the passivation layer formed of an inorganic oxide. In other words, since the passivation layer includes an inorganic oxide, the passivation layer 15 more easily captures (suppress) surplus carriers generated during a deposition process, thereby preventing the deterioration of electrical properties, due to the surplus carriers.
[0053]
Also, the passivation layer of the present invention prevents the deterioration of transistor properties, due to external light. Although GaInZnO, which is a compound semiconductor, has a large band gap, surplus carriers are generated if light is absorbed thereon, so that a leakage current may occur, and transistor properties may be degraded. In particular, a bottom gate structure is more susceptible to external light, as compared to a top gate structure.
[0054]
As shown in FIG. 5B, if the passivation layer 15 is formed of silicon oxide (SiO2), which has a large band gap, the external light is not blocked efficiently. Therefore, the transfer properties of the transistor deteriorated, as shown in FIG. 8A. In FIG. 8A, light of 0 to 20000 Lux was applied to the thin film transistor, when a 5.1V voltage Vds was applied to the source and drain electrodes 16 a and 16 b.
[0055]
However, in the thin film transistor of the present invention, as shown in FIG. 6B, the passivation layer is formed of an inorganic oxide, such as Ga2O3, which has a relatively small band gap, so that the external light is absorbed with ease. Therefore, the activation layer was protected from the external light by the passivation layer, and detachment of oxygen due to the optical absorption of light are prevented, the transfer properties of the transistor were preserved, as shown in FIG. 8B.
[0056]
The deterioration of the activation layer, due to the absorption of light may cause a deterioration of image quality and an increase of power consumption of a display device including the thin film transistor. Therefore, a conventional amorphous silicon thin film transistor generally has a dual gate structure, a lightly doped drain (LDD) structure, or an offset structure, which can reduce a leakage current. However, in this case, there are problems that the drain current in a turned-on state is reduced, and additional processes are added. However, with the present invention, since the passivation layer is formed of inorganic oxide having a small band gap, external light is efficiently absorbed, so there is no need to add a separate process or device for compensating for the deterioration of the electrical properties.
[0057]
FIG. 9 is a cross-sectional view of a thin film transistor, according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention. While the passivation layer 15 of the thin film transistor of FIG. 1 is formed across the activation layer 14 and the insulating film 13, the thin film transistor of FIG. 9 comprises a passivation layer 25 formed only on the activation layer. In addition, source and drain electrodes 26 a and 26 b contact source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c of the activation layer 14, without passing through contact holes in the passivation layer 15, as shown in FIG. 1.
[0058]
The activation layer 14 can be protected by the passivation layer 25, and the contact resistance can also be reduced, by the direct contact of the source and drain electrodes 26 a and 26 b to the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c. The passivation layer 25 can be formed of the same materials as the passivation layer 15.
[0059]
The thin film transistor of FIG. 9 can be manufactured using the same method as the thin film transistor of FIG. 1, except that instead for forming the contact holes 15 a by patterning the passivation layer 15, a portion of the passivation layer 25 is removed during patterning, such that the passivation layer 25 is only present on a portion of the activation layer 14.
[0060]
