The present innovation provides a method of establishing a connection between two individuals using an interpersonal spacetime interaction system, including enabling a first user to specify a spacetime event and to provide annotations for the spacetime event, maintaining a spacetime database comprising data objects, each data object corresponding to a spacetime event, querying a spacetime database, using a query that includes at least a specification of a desired spacetime event, said query being initiated by a second user, retrieving information from those data objects in the spacetime database whose corresponding spacetime events are proximate to the desired spacetime event, and providing the retrieved information to the second user.
