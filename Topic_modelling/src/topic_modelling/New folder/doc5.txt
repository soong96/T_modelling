Social networking services, such as Facebook, Twitter, MySpace and Orkut, are changing our communication habits by introducing new tools that simplify and increase on-line interaction. The exemplary embodiments present methods for measuring the social strength among contacts on the basis of users' on-line interactions, which may be significantly used in real-time collaborative task management (e.g., inviting contacts for collaboration, selecting suitable tools for communication, prioritizing information flow). Moreover, exemplary embodiments provide a framework for developing new mobile social networking applications (social search client, smart dialer or contact applications) by extending the use of social ranking of contacts. Exemplary embodiments aggregate contact information from different communication sources and then harness the interaction patterns together with social strength between contacts, for instance by using communication history (interaction logs) and process mining techniques, to build an aggregated social graph that describes a user's communication habit.
