BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]
1. Field of the Invention
[0003]
Aspects of the present invention relate to a thin film transistor, a method of manufacturing the same, and a flat panel display device having the same.
[0004]
2. Description of the Related Art
[0005]
A thin film transistor generally includes an activation layer having a channel region, a source region, and a drain region, and a gate electrode, which is formed on an upper or lower portion of the channel region and is electrically insulated from the activation layer by a gate insulating film.
[0006]
The activation layer of the thin film transistor formed as described above is generally formed of semiconductor material, such as amorphous silicon or poly-silicon (i.e., polycrystalline silicon). However, if the activation layer is formed of the amorphous silicon, it is difficult to implement a high speed driving circuit due to low electron/hole mobility therein; and if the activation layer is formed of the poly-silicon, a separate compensation circuit should be added due to an uneven threshold voltage, despite high electron/hole mobility. Also, a conventional method of manufacturing the thin film transistor using a low temperature poly-silicon (LTPS) includes an expensive process, such as a laser annealing, etc., and is difficult to control the properties of the resultant transistors.
[0007]
Compound semiconductors have recently been suggested as an activation layer in order to solve such problems. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2004-273614 discloses a thin film transistor having an activation layer form mainly of zinc oxide (ZnO) or a compound semiconductor having zinc oxide (ZnO).
[0008]
The compound semiconductor having zinc oxide (ZnO) as a main ingredient is evaluated as an amorphous, stable material. If such a compound semiconductor is used as an activation layer, the compound semiconductor has various advantages in that the thin film transistor may be manufactured at a low temperature below 350° C. using existing processing equipment and an ion implantation process may be omitted.
[0009]
However, if the compound semiconductor is used, when forming a thin film on an upper portion of the activation layer or etching the formed thin film, damage due to plasma is generated such that a change in an electrical property is generated. The negative changes in electrical properties may include an increase in carriers due to a bombardment effect and a radiation effect, etc. Because of the deterioration of the electrical properties of the compound semiconductor, a change in threshold voltage of the thin film transistor, etc., and a degree of dispersion of the electrical properties within a substrate deteriorate.
[0010]
In a thin film transistor having an activation layer formed of poly-silicon, a passivation layer is generally formed of silicon oxide SiO2, silicon nitride SiNx or aluminum oxide Al2O3. However, in a thin film transistor having an activation layer formed of a compound semiconductor including oxygen, if a passivation layer is formed of silicon oxide SiO2, silicon nitride SiNx or aluminum oxide Al2O3, it causes deterioration in electrical properties. The deterioration in the electrical properties is inferred to be the result of damage of the activation layer generated by plasma during a deposition process. If the damage due to plasma is generated, carrier concentration of the activation layer may be increased because of oxygen deficiency, off current may be increased because of such an excess carrier, and an S-factor property may deteriorate.

[0028]
FIGS. 1A and 1B are cross-sectional views showing a thin film transistor according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 1A, a buffer layer 11 is formed on a substrate 10 and a gate electrode 12 is formed on the buffer layer 11. A gate insulating film 13 is formed on the substrate to cover at least the gate electrode 12, and an activation layer 14 formed of a compound semiconductor is formed on the gate insulating film 13. The activation layer 14 provides a channel region 14 a, a source region 14 b, and a drain region 14 c, wherein the channel region 14 a overlaps the gate electrode 12. Also, a passivation layer 15 is formed on the activation layer 14 in at least the channel region 14 a, and source and drain electrodes 16 a and 16 b contact the activation layer 14 in the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c.
[0029]
FIG. 1A shows a structure where the passivation layer 15 is formed on the activation layer 14 in the channel region 14 a, and the passivation layer 15 is formed on the entirety of the upper portion of the substrate 10 including the activation layer 14 such that the source and drain electrodes 16 a and 16 b contact the activation layer 14 in the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c through contact holes formed on the passivation layer 15. In contrast, FIG. 1B shows a structure where the passivation layer 15 is formed only on the activation layer 14 in the channel region 14 a such that the source and drain electrodes 16 a and 16 b contact the activation layer 14 in the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c directly.
[0030]
The activation layer 14 is formed of a compound semiconductor including oxygen, for example, zinc oxide (ZnO), wherein the compound semiconductor may be doped with at least one ion selected from a group consisting of gallium (Ga), indium (In), tin (Sn), zirconium (Zr), hafnium (Hf), and vanadium (V). Also, the passivation layer 15 is formed of titanium oxide (TiOx) or titanium oxynitride (TiOxNy).
[0031]
Now, aspects of the present invention will be described in more detail through a method of manufacturing a thin film transistor. FIGS. 2A to 2D are cross-sectional views showing a method of manufacturing a thin film transistor according to aspects of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 2A, after a buffer layer 11 is formed on a substrate 10, a gate electrode 12 is formed on the buffer layer and a gate insulating film 13 is formed on the substrate to cover at least the gate electrode 12. As the substrate 10, a semiconductor substrate, such as silicon Si, etc., an insulating substrate, such as glass or plastic, etc., or a metal substrate is used. The gate electrode 12 may be formed of a metal, such as Al, Cr, and MoW, etc., or a conductive polymer, etc., and the gate insulating film 13 may be formed of insulating material, such as SiO2, SiNx, and Ga2O3, etc.
[0032]
Referring to FIG. 2B, an activation layer 14 formed of a compound semiconductor is formed on the gate insulating film 13. The activation layer 14 includes a channel region 14 a, a source region 14 b, and a drain region 14 c, wherein the channel region 14 a overlaps the gate electrode 12. The activation layer 14 is formed of a compound semiconductor including oxygen, for example, zinc oxide (ZnO), wherein the compound semiconductor may be doped with at least one ion selected from a group consisting of gallium (Ga), indium (In), tin (Sn), zirconium (Zr), hafnium (Hf), and vanadium (V). For example, the compound semiconductor may be ZnO, ZnGaO, ZnInO, ZnSnO, and GaInZnO, etc.
[0033]
Referring to FIG. 2C, after a passivation layer 15 that includes titanium oxide (TiOx) is formed on the substrate over the activation layer 14, the passivation layer 15 is patterned to form contact holes 15 a so that the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c of the activation layer 14 are exposed. During the patterning of the passivation layer, the passivation layer 15 may be patterned to leave behind only on the upper portion of the activation layer 14 in the channel region 14 a, as shown in FIG. 1B.
[0034]
The passivation layer 15 that includes the titanium oxide (TiOx) protects the activation layer 14 from moisture or oxygen, and prevents the activation layer 14 from being contaminated or damaged. Since the titanium oxide (TiOx) (x=0.3˜3.0) and the titanium oxynitride (TiOxNy) (x=0.3˜3.0; y=0.3˜5.0) that is used as the passivation layer 15, can be deposited using a direct current (DC) reactive sputtering method using a metal target, it can be applied to a large area substrate, making it possible to easily make the display device large. For example, the titanium oxide (TiOx) or the titanium oxynitride (TiOxNy) can be deposited on a large area substrate while controlling the amount of oxygen (O) and nitrogen (N) using the DC reactive sputtering method using a titanium (Ti) target.
[0035]
For reference, an inorganic material, such as oxide or nitride, is commonly deposited using a RF sputtering method or a chemical vapor deposition method. However, the RF sputtering method has disadvantages in that a deposition rate is low and the deposition is not easily performed for a large substrate. The chemical vapor deposition method also has disadvantages in that the electrical properties of the compound semiconductor are deteriorated since oxygen is diffused during the deposition process. In contrast, the DC reactive sputtering method can deposit a thin film stably on a large area substrate. However, since gallium (Ga) or aluminum (Al), etc., has a low melting point or generates a serious arc discharge, a proper metal target should be selected. Titanium (Ti) may be deposited stably on a large area substrate of 730 mm×920 mm, i.e., a fourth-generation substrate, or more using the DC reactive sputtering method. Therefore, if the amount (partial pressure) of oxygen (O) and nitrogen (N) is properly controlled during the deposition process, titanium oxide (TiOx) or titanium oxynitride (TiOxNy) having a desired layer can be deposited.
[0036]
Referring to FIG. 2D, after a conductive layer formed of Mo, MoW, Al, AlNd, and AlLiLa, etc., is formed on the passivation layer 15 so that the contact holes 15 a are filled and the conductive layer contacts the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c of the activation layer 14, the conductive layer is patterned to form source and drain electrodes 16 a and 16 b connected to the source and drain regions 14 b and 14 c through the contact holes 15 a. The passivation layer 15 may be used as an etch stop layer during the patterning process of the conductive layer thereby making it possible to make the etching process easy, to protect the activation layer 14 in the channel region 14 a, and to prevent the activation layer 14 from being contaminated by an organic material, etc., during a subsequent process.
[0037]
FIGS. 3A to 3C are graphs showing transfer curves in drain current Id according to gate voltage Vg before and after the passivation layer 15 is formed. In FIG. 3A, the partial pressure of oxygen (O2) was controlled to 15%; in FIG. 3B, the partial pressure of oxygen (O2) was controlled to 19%; and in FIG. 3C, the partial pressure of nitrogen (N2) was controlled to 13%. In FIGS. 3A to 3C, lines A1, A11, and A21, and lines A2, A12, and A22 represent measurement results before the passivation layer was formed, measured when voltage Vds between the source and drain electrodes 16 a and 16 b was in the range of 0.1V and 5.1V; and lines B1, B11, and B21, and lines B2, B12, and B22 represent the measurement results after the passivation layer was formed, measured when voltage Vds between the source and drain electrodes 16 a and 16 b was in the range of 0.1V and 5.1V.
[0038]
As shown in FIGS. 3A to 3C, the change in threshold voltage before and after the passivation layer is formed is very small, thereby indicating that the activation layer 14 was not contaminated or damaged by the passivation layer 15.
[0039]
