A system and method are provided for sharing data of a user with contacts, the method comprising collecting the contacts from the user, collecting data related to the communications between the user and his contacts, and automatically grouping the contacts into different groups based on a level of communications between the user and the user's contacts, defining an access level for each group, with each access level granting access to some part of the user's data based on the access level. Advantageously, this permits a dynamic assignment of authority to access content that does not have to be actively managed by the user.
